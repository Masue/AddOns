An addon for World of Warcraft 1.12.1 that kicks
people based on group number, moves recipients
to empty groups and then reinvites everyone.

1st /meep will select a group (empty group if possible, target's group if not)
2nd /meep will kick selected group and move target to empty group.
3rd and more /meep will swap target into the group and the previous target
back to its original position or swap back to original position and re-invite
if there is no target selected.
