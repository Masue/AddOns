#BoldMLBug

Addon for WoW 1.12.1 clients to help mitigate problems with the ML-bug on feenix's servers.

##Commands:
/meep help - display explanation of /meep below
/meep - 1st /meep selects a group (empty if possible, target's if not). 2nd /meep kicks selected group's members and moves current target to the now empty group. 3rd and consecutive /meep moves back old target to original group and moves current target to empty group. End ML-session with /meep without someone targeted (will move back to original positions and re-invite).
